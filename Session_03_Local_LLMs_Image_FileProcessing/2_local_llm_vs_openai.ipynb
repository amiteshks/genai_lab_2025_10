      "- Main issue: Two federal judges ruled the Trump administration must tap emergency funds to partially cover November SNAP benefits amid a government shutdown, but many benefits could still be delayed.\n",

      "- Scope of SNAP use:\n",
      "  - Nearly 42 million people received food stamps in May (USDA data).\n",
      "  - About 12% of the U.S. population relies on SNAP.\n",
      "\n",

      "  - November 1: ~3 million recipients\n",

      "  - November 10: ~26.6 million\n",
      "  - Remaining enrollees after Nov. 10\n",
      "\n",
      "- Who relies on SNAP:\n",
      "  - Households with children, an elderly person, or a non-elderly person with a disability account for 83% of SNAP benefits (FY2023).\n",
      "  - Recipients themselves: ~39% children; 20% elderly; 10% nonelderly with a disability.\n",
      "  - Average benefit: about $350 per month per household.\n",
      "  - About 75% of SNAP households have income below 100% of the federal poverty level.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Context and consequences:\n",
      "  - Benefits don’t expire each month, but funds are typically used in the month received.\n",
      "  - The shutdown adds strain to an already stretched emergency food system.\n",
      "  - States cannot fully cover the roughly $8 billion in monthly SNAP benefits; some will add money to emergency food programs, but not at federal levels.\n",

      "- Correction note: An earlier version had incorrect totals for how many people would receive SNAP benefits on specific November dates due to a data error from Code for America.\n",
