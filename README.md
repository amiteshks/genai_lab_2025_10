## 🧑‍💻 Hands-On Projects

1. **AI Tutor Bot** — Contextual answering using RAG  
2. **Legal Copilot** — Extract clauses and deadlines from contracts  
3. **Finance Copilot** — NLQ to SQL + reconciliation insights  
4. **Agent Workflow Builder** — No-code orchestration with LangGraph & AgentKit  
5. **Eval Dashboard** — Tracking context precision, recall, and correctness over time

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

We measure AI system performance via:

| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Context Precision** | % of retrieved chunks that are relevant |
| **Context Recall** | % of relevant chunks retrieved |
| **Faithfulness** | Alignment between generated answer and source context |
| **Answer Correctness** | Accuracy of the model’s response |
| **Latency & Cost** | Response time and token efficiency |

## 📚 Homework & Assignments

Each session includes:
- A **warm-up lab** (Python or RAG task)
- **Homework notebook** (to be submitted before next session)
- **Solution reference** with API docs links
